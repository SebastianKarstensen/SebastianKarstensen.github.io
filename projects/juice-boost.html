			<h2>In an attempt to supply players with a fun and competitive experience, this "fruity" racing game for up to 5 players was developed as part of a course on game design.</h2>
			
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>We started out by defining our intended player experience - what do we want the players to feel during the game? Our original goal was to create an asymmetrical multiplayer game, where one player would have a different, more powerful role in the game. Inspired by a trip to the grocery store, we settled on creating a racing game set on the conveyor belt of a supermarket. One player would throw items on the conveyor belt in an attempt to prevent the other players (who are controlling fruits) from reaching the end of the belt.</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>After adding support for multiple "fruit"-players, we changed the focus to be on the competitiveness between the fruits instead of a 1v4 experience. The player throwing obstacles onto the conveyor belt became more of a game facilitator than an actual player. We still aimed at making the person feel powerful, and tried to keep in strategic choices by letting the player select what items to throw and where to throw them. This gave the player a choice of how they wanted to facilitate the game; either as a relaxed (almost AI-controlled) facilitator, or a very engage facilitator, aiming at creating specific experiences for the players.</p>
			
			<p>From the beginning, we had a goal of making sure the players controlling the oranges felt agile and quick. After many iterations on the controls, we ended up with a version of physics-based rolling, which was still responsive enough for players to feel in control throughout the entire game. Our biggest change came in the jump mechanic. It was initially possible for the oranges to jump whenever, but this led to a huge imbalance in the game, as the obstacles could easily be jumped. Therefore, we gave the ability a cooldown, forcing players to wait a few seconds before being able to jump again. This was a very important step in the competitiveness aspect of the game, as the previous versions did not have much player interaction. Because of the limited impact the obstacles had on the players, once one player was in front of the pack they would be almost unstoppable, and it would not be possible for other players to catch up. The recharge of the jump mechanic made sure that players had to utilize the jump mechanic at the right time to keep their speed. This resulted in players constantly overtaking each other, and showed us the level of engagement and competitiveness we were going for.</p> 

			<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
			<p>In the end, we ended up with a simple, but quite entertaining game. The intended player experience shines clearly when observing 4 players intensely competing for crossing the finish line, and the fifth player is able to impact the game as they see fit, creating an enjoyable role as facilitator.</p>

			<p>Working on the project showed just how important of a tool prototyping can be. Many times, we built a new game simply for testing and evaluating a specific mechanic, before introducing it to the game. It also proved valuable in making design decisions, as we often were convinced that a feature was important/irrelevant until getting hands-on with a prototype. Before deciding on a racing game, several other ideas were investigated, also using prototypes.</p>
