			<h2>Gateway is a student organization with the goal of bringing various entertaining events to the students of the IT-University. Their previous website was outdated and difficult to maintain, so I build <a href="http://www.gatewayitu.dk">a new one</a>.</h2>
			
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Gateway's previous website was build in WordPress, and although the design could use an update, it worked. Visitors were able to find upcoming events, post ideas for future projects, sign-up for the organization, and see the team behind it. However, the overall package was a bit confusing to navigate around, and updating the site with new events was only possible for the IT-role of the board. As the person responsible for this resigned, and no other member stepped up for the position, a new solution had to be found.</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>I decided to make a static website written in HTML and CSS and hosted on GitHub Pages. Everyone with knowledge of Git would then be able to clone the repository and update as needed. In an attempt to simplify the website and give it a more modern look, I decided to use the fullPage.js library by √Ålvaro Trigo. The plan was to split every page from the previous website into one-page sections of the site: "Home", "Events", "Join", "Organization", "Social Media", and "About".</p>

			<p>Together with the previous website developer, we decided that the landing page should be streamlined and display the bare minimum information needed. Therefore, the homepage contains but the Gateway logo, information about the next event, and links to Facebook and Instagram. A photo from a previous barbeque event covers the entire background, and a menu on the right indicates other sections of the site. The rest of the page shares the same simplistic look, and has been tinted in the official Gateway colors (maybe not the most aesthetically pleasing design choice, but it helps in keeping an overall theme throughout the different sections).</p>

			<p>One of my favourite parts of the website is based on an idea from another member: as the organization was already using Google Drive for planning events, would it be possible to connect the two platforms? As most members had access to the online storage system, it would make it easier to keep updated. With a little bit of JavaScript (and help from online resources), the site would now retrieve information from a spreadsheet in the Google Drive-folder, and inject raw HTML into the "Events"-section. This way, members simply had to add a name, a date, and a link to the Facebook event and cover photo, then the event would show up on the website. The same approach was used for the "Organization"-section, which displays all current members of Gateway (this time around, hosting the images was done directly in Google Drive).</p>

			<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
			<p>What really enticed me about this project was the fact that I could work on everything from generating ideas to polishing the UI. As the previous website was not going to be maintained anyway, I was given a blank canvas to work on, with the only requirements being what content should be included. This allowed me to design the site exactly as I saw it fit, while getting feedback from other members of the organization. In regards to web development, the main learning outcomes came from fullpage.js and using Google Drive as a database. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the final product, which packages the content from the previous website into a more modern, mobile-friendly site.</p>
