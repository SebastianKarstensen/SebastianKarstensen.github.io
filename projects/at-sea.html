			<h2>I concluded my BSc of Science by writing this group project on procedural content generation. Throughout the project, we wanted to uncover an area of PCG that has yet to be further explored: the weather. The university used our project for one of their promotional videos, which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT54BcSikPQ">here</a> (in Danish).</h2>
			
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>In recent years, indie game development has grown in popularity, and much of the success can be attributed to procedural content generation. It is now possible for smaller teams to create games of comparable scale to big budget games, and it is not rare to see a game containing an inﬁnite amount of levels. Throughout this project, we wanted to uncover an area of PCG that has yet to be further explored, the weather. We attempted to answer the question: How can you procedurally generate a weather system, which can be used as a game mechanic in a video game?</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>Our first objective was to create a system, which could generate information about different weather elements that we could then use in a ganme. We ended up generating data for temperature, wind, and cloud coverage modelled based on mathematical functions (for instance, sine waves and Perlin noise). A Markov chain was used to switch between neutral and rainy weather, in which the transition probabilities are depending on other weather elements such as cloud cover.</p>

			<p>To use the weather system as a core game mechanic, we developed a small game in Unity, where the player controls a sailboat and is guided by the wind. Certain locations are only accessible at speciﬁc water levels, which depends on the temperature and rain. The wind impacts the speed at which the player can travel certain direction. As the weather is procedurally generated, we wanted to make sure the player did not need to rely on the system to create specific scenarios needed for them to succeed. As a result of this, the game created for this project does not use PCG as a condition to win, but rather as a catalyst for diﬀerent experiences. The weather system shapes the exploration of the game, and allows you to go certain places in the game world, but also prevents you from going to others. This ensures that each player will have a unique experience.</p>

			<p>For testing our hypothesis, we set up a series of user tests at the university. We observed the gameplay during the testing sessions, and asked the players to fill out a questionnaire afterwards. Finally, we combined this with the process of telemetry, where code embedded in the game collects raw data about the game. This gave us a significant of data for analyzing weather or not our procedurally generated weather system was viable as an integral game mechanic.</p>

			<p>Although the mechanics worked as intended, our main finding was the importance of communication to the player. One one hand, the way the wind was used as a game mechanic determined that with the appropriate means of displaying information, it is possible to create an experience based on weather conditions that is meaningful to the player. On the other hand, the interaction between temperature and water level was vague, because the temperature did not stand out to the player, and therefore the mechanic failed to reach full potential.</p>

			<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
			<p>There is no doubt that simulation of weather is difficult. When generating weather for a game, it is important to have weather models that are easily understandable by the player. The project showed that weather definitely can be used as an enjoyable game mechanic, which provides the circumstances for unique experiences. However, if one intends to base the player’s strategy around weather mechanics, the weather information needs to be communicated visually to the player in a useful way. This gives an indication as to why weather only have visual impacts on most games.</p>
