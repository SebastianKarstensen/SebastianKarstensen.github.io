			<h2>Autobook is an Android application for scheduling text messages and social media updates, which was developed as part of a course at Syracuse University.</h2>
			
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>As technology takes bigger part of our daily life, sending congratulatory cards in the mail has become obsolete. Most birthday wishes arrive on social media outlets, like Twitter &amp; Facebook, and the general contact platform for most people is our mobile phones. However, our contacts are still split amongst these many platforms, and requires users to have several applications to message the same people. In addition to this, it would sometimes be nice if a social media message could be scheduled for a certain time (for instance, an upcoming anniversary), so you won't have to wait until the day to express yourself.</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>Autobook is an Android application, which allows the user to plan their social media interactions on their phone. You simply setup an event at a specific date and time, and choose what message to send, who to send it to, and how to send it. To see the features of the app, take a look at the tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHuEwSJT3K8">here</a>.</p>

			<p>The project was part of the course "Software Implementation". The previous semester, students have worked with software specification, and thus the majority of the requirements for the project had already been developed. Since I was at Syracuse University for a semester abroad, I joined the project halfway through. It was interesting to enter a project in the middle of development, and try to get the same mindset as the team that had done all previous work. It allowed me to focus less on user requirements and system architecture, and more on the actual implementation itself.</p>

			<p>We started by creating mockups for the screens, investigating what the best way to present the features of the app to the user. Part of the challenge was coming up with a design that would also fit the screen in landscape mode. Even though we only had one screen for creating any type of event (Twitter, Facebook, or text messaging), we still decide to make an individual button for each platform on the home screen. We estimate that most of the events scheduled will only use one platform, and thus it would be better if the user could choose from the main screen, instead of doing it in the process of creating an event. Overall, I think we came up with an acceptable design, which does not look terrible.</p>

			<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
			<p>Autobook turned out to be quite a fun project to work on, as it allowed us to go through the entire implementation process, from mockups to finished product. We worked on all parts of the system, both backend and frontend, and also managed to gett some experience regarding the integration of Facebook &amp; Twitter authentication.</p>
