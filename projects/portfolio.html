			<h2>This website was originally an exam project in a web development course, but has been redesigned several times since. I use it as a portfolio to display personal projects and skills, as well as providing contact information for those wanting to get in touch.</h2>
			
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>As a software developer, it is quite valuable for me to be able to show my work. Since web development is one of my interests, I thought it would be a great way to build a site for my portfolio, while practicing my HTML/CSS skills. The main objective of the portfolio is to allow my to display projects I have been involved with, while allowing me to comment on the development process. Furthermore, I wanted the website to also show my creative skills in terms of media creation, and finally provide contact information in case visitors are interested in reaching out to me.</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>Starting off as an exam project, the first version of the site acted as a proof of concept, as I was still in the early fase of learning web development. It did allow me to play around with Javascript a bit, which gave me inspiration for the theme that the second version revolved around.</p>

			<p>For the second iteration of the website, I wanted to create a more visual dependent experience. The homepage was centered around my interests, displaying an image of myself surrounded by a range of objects representing my skills. These items would expand when clicked and a supporting text would appear. Unfortunately, the image heavy idea worked awful on devices connected to the celular network, and the orientation of the device had to be landscape for perfect viewing of the site.</p>

			<p>Due to the mobile issues, I decided to go back to the drawing board. This time, I wanted to use a mobile first approach to make sure the website was responsive, and settled on using the Bootstrap-framework to ease development. The end result was acceptable, but the overall design felt disconnected and messy. Furthermore, after working with Bootstrap, I realized that the main features I used could easily be replicated using media queries, and give me back the control I gave up by using a third party library.</p>

			<p>... and thus we ended up with the current site. In my opinion, it is a big step forward from what I originally produced at Syracuse University back in 2015. A simple design combined with custom animations makes sure the portfolio is user-friendly, while allowing the small details to provide a pleasant visual experience.</p>

			<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
			<p>Beside the experience I have obtained regarding web development (mainly using HTML, CSS, and Javascript), this ongoing project clearly shows the power of iteration. Every redesign of the website has been a step forward, and by holding on to the parts that works while discarding elements that are unsatisfying, the improvements show by each repetition cycle. Who knows, maybe this site will look completely different in a year?</p>
