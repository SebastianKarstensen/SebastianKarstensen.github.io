The intended player experience shines clearly when observing 4 players intensely competing for crossing the finish line, and the fifth player is able to impact the game as they see fit, creating an enjoyable role as facilitator. Working on the project showed just how important of a tool prototyping can be. Many times, we built a new game simply for testing and evaluating a specific mechanic, before introducing it to the game. It also proved valuable in making design decisions, as we often were convinced that a feature was important/irrelevant until getting hands-on with a prototype. Before deciding on a racing game, several other ideas were investigated, also using prototypes.",
